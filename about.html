    <p>Once I made an acrostic, but there was no good webpage on which to host one. So I made my own.
        <b>How to Play</b>
        On the main page, you can import a json file containing an acrostic by pressing the "Choose File" button. You probably got provided a .json by whoever linked this webpage to you.
        You can then type in letters into the squares for both the clues and the quote. Each square has a corresponding square that is also filled in with the same letter.
        When you think you're done, press the "Check full solution" answer. It will tell you if you've completed the puzzle, and if not mark the incorrect letters in red.
        If you're correct, "Explanation" buttons will appear next to each clue, which you can click on to see the reasoning behind said clue.
        You can also check an individual letter or indiviudal clue, or if you're stuck, reveal an individual letter.
        <b>Create Your Own</b>
        On the generator page, you can make your own acrostic, which you can share with your friends family and community. 
        Type in your Quote in the quote box. Then type in various Clues, their Answers, and an Explanation of why the Clue makes sense. You can add more rows to the answer table by pressing the green button, and delete a row by pressing the red button in that row. 
        You can press the "Save Draft" button at any time to download a json with your Work in Progress, which you can import later to work on some more. This json <b>cannot</b> be used to play the acrostic, as it is missing information. 
        To get a playable puzzle json, click the "Generate Puzzle" button. First it will check if your puzzle is valid, ie. that the letters of the answers are the same as the letters in the quote (numbers whitespace and punctuation don't count). If invalid, it will tell you what letters you have too few of in the answers, or too many of in the answers. If it is valid, it will generate a json that you can open in the main section.
        You can also check if the solution is valid at any time by pressing the "Check if valid" button.
